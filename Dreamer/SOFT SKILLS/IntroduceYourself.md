**Hi, I’m Disha Shetty, a 3rd-year Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Sahyadri College of Engineering, with a strong academic record and a GPA of 9.2.**

I’m passionate about building tech solutions that solve real-world problems. I’ve worked extensively on full-stack development using the **MERN stack** and have strong command over **Java (Object-Oriented Programming)** and **Data Structures & Algorithms**.

One of my key projects is **Mediflow**, an AI-integrated doctor appointment system with disease prediction features. I’ve also built **Eduford**, a mock interview platform that gives automated AI-based feedback — both of which gave me deep hands-on experience in building scalable, impactful applications.

Beyond technical skills, I enjoy **mentoring and leading** — as a mentor at SOSC, I’ve trained 100+ students in C, DSA, Git, and Web Development, and also helped organize college hackathons.

I’ve also anchored multiple college events, which helped me develop **strong communication, stage presence, and confidence** — something I carry into team collaborations and presentations.

I’ve completed certifications in **Full Stack Web Development**, **Java OOPs**, and a **virtual internship with SkyScanner**, and I’m currently focused on sharpening my problem-solving and system design skills to become a well-rounded developer.

What drives me is the opportunity to contribute to innovative teams, build meaningful products, and never stop learning. I’m actively seeking an internship or entry-level role where I can **grow while delivering real value** through my skills.

**I’m truly excited about the possibility of joining a company like yours that values innovation, impact, and continuous learning — and I’d love to bring my energy and skills to your team.**
