process?
.cpp -> compiler -> compile -> creates an executable file -> program

program under exicution is process

program is in hard disk, process is in RAM

why process?
user has to do a work, he'll write a program that program gets converted to process

steps?
load the program and static data to memory
allocate runtime stack
stack is a part of memory used for local variables and return value
allocate heap part of memory used for dynamic memory access
unix handler - i/p,o/p,error
os handoff control to main()

architecture of process
stack

heap -
data - global,static variable
text - compiled code
