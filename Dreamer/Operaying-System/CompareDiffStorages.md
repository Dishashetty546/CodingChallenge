Register?
smallest unit of storage
closest to CPU
arithmetic operations happens here

Cache?
temporary memory unit
CPU needs more data stored here
Same instructions used very often, they are stored here
so it is stored in primary memory

Main memory?
CPU contacts and get instructions

Secondaey memory?
programs are present here, they are then handed to main memory

Comparison?
-Cost
Registers are full of transitors, used or formed by rare materials, they are more costly, because they are kept close to CPU
Cache are more cheap then registers, costly then Main memory

-speed
Register>cache> main memory ....

-Storage size
Smallest - Registers

-Valatability
cache, registers - data get vanished when we power off the device

whereas main memory and secondary memory are permanent memory
