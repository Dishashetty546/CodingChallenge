32 bits vs 64 bits?

32 bit os has 32 bit registers
it can access 2^32 unique memory addresses, 4gb of memory space
64 bit os has 64 bit registers, it can access 2^64 memory address

advantages of 64 but ?
addressable memory
resource usage - instaiing more RAM on a system wihth a 32 bit os doesnt make impact moe , updating with 64 bit windows will
performance
compatibility - 64 bit os can run both 64 biits and 32 bits, whereas 32 bit can only run 32 bit
better graphic performance

bilions of transistors are present in a chip cpu in a motherboard
its an individual data circuits
4 bytes
1 bytes = 32 bit

there are different os , one with 32 bit another is 64 bit

CPU CYCLES

32 BIT CPU?
0 ........32
32 unique addresses
2^0........2^32
ex: if we want to manipualate a 64 bit data
then cpu will divide the work to 2 parts 32 bits each
then double work more time - 2 cycle

64 BIT CPU?
0.......64
ex: at once will manipulate 64 bit data, - 1cycle

Advacntage for 64 ?
more memory addrees
more data allocation
resource allocation and right usage
performance
Compatibility - can run both 32 and 64 bit's works
high graphical computations
