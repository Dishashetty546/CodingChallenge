ML - subdomain of computer science that focuseson algo which help computer to learn from data without explicit programming
AI - area of cs where is goal is to enable computers and machines perfprm human like tasks and simulate human behavious
DS - tjis feild attempts to find patterns and draw insights from data( might use Ml)

types of Ml

supervised learning - uses labaled imouts( i/p has corresponding o/p label) to train model and learn o/patterns
ex: there is three images placed ,all these images are labelled with some name ex: cat dog lizard

unsupervised learning -  uses unlabelled data to learn about patterns in data
ex: i/p is images with no labells

Reinforcement learning - agent learning in interactive environment based on rewards and penalties
ex: robot on going rigth path gets water or wrong path gets fire

supervised learning
   inputs -> model -> output

::INPUT::
   categorial data ( finite no. of data)

   nominal data( no inherent order)

categorial data - convery string value to numerical value

technics - ONE HOT ENCODING

EX: instead of INDIA, CANADA, USA, FRANCE
INDIA  [1,0,0,0]
USA [0,1,0,0]
CANADA [0,0,1,0]
FRANCE [0,0,0,1]

::OUTPUT::

classification predict discrete classes - multiclass classification

binary classification - positive/negative , cat/dog , spam/not spam
multiple classification - cat/dog/dolphin, orange/apple/pear , plant species

Regression - predict continuois values

model
datasets divided into traing and testing data
testing -> model -> testing

LOSS FUNCTION - L1 LOSS - LOSS = SUM([YREAL - YPREDICTED])
