-------------------------------------------------------------computer essential parts-----------------------------------------------

1. case
2.power supply
3.mother board
4.cpu 
5.RAM
6.Hard Drive
7.Graphics card


case: plastic box,
its an enclosed surface for all the hardware cadgets

power supply: present on lower part of any computer, regulates power

Mother board: circuit board,which communicates b/w all components, realtively cheap

cpu: central processing unit or processor 
     does things
     dont do storing of data things
     most of our programs essentially run from.
     they are known as "BIG BRAIN OF COMPUTERS"
     everything thats happening goes to CPU at some point

RAM: random access memeory
     small storage space
     fast access points

Hard Drives:Disk drives or D- drives, storage
            data/files actually stored
            large data storage space
            but, slow access

ex: hard drives are kind of large storing garege area, where finding things would be difficult , wheras RAM small storage area, kind of small shop where finding things is essentially

Graphics card: GPU : graphics processing unit
                     one's and 0's shoudld be constantly getting updates into bunch of animated videos and photo contents, and display this on moniter
                     standalone computer

ex: displaying a 3d video in a game, CPU will be doing this by collecting info from RAM, RAM gets data by figuring out from Hard drives, then graphic cards knows how and when to display all these
