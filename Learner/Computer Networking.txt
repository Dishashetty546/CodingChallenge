-----------------COMPUTER NETWORKING--------------------------------------------------
 Internet: connecting two or more computers
TCP-transmition control protocol
Protocol: sending a email to someonr will require some steps, or talking to a friend, maybe convaying some msg through video--> thses all should be conveyed in someway, like data should be transferred fully without any glitch or small glitch is fine --> these are termed as protocol
UDP
IP-internet protocol

WWW-world wide web--by timp burner
which stores thes documents

rules to set or build an application:
rfc- request for comments
internet soceity will set all these rules

eq; google.co m --->request set to googe
                              <---response is sent

protocols:rules and regulations framed by internert soceity they are known as protocol
Types of protocols:
TCP: data will be reached to destination with 100% purity is data, and ensure with feedback
UDP: here we dont care if 1005 data is transferred or name , video conferance
(User datagram protocol)
HTTP:hyper text transfer protocol, how sender sends request to receiver how recicer sends the rewuest these rules are defned here

How data is transfered?
evverything in computer are in 0 or 1
all the data is transferred through packets

how does it knowns if we type google.com how will it connect to google?
its using  its ip address, all the computer networks are identifies using an ip address

IP(Internet providor) address of our own computer---$ curl if config.me -s

Internet service providor(ISP)---Modem/router  is connected--->they are having an Ip address--> To router we connect number of devices D1,D2,D3 having diff IP address using DHCP ptrotocol
All the devices connected through same router or modem , when they send any request-->request will be sent through Global Ip address--> so they all having same IP address for request

BUT how to differnciate them -----> using PORT NUMBER
IP-where your computer is located
pn- which application used oto communicate

PORT NUMBER---16 bit number---->having 16 cells
so total portnumber can be designed is 2^16===65000

Web pages use HTTP protocol-->evrything happens in PORT 80
                            MongoDB port nuumber is 2712
                            SQL--1433
some port numbers are already reserved like port --->0-1023
                                            1024-49152--->these port numbers are already reserved for some applications
remaining anyone can use

1mbps- mega bits per sec--1000000 bits/s
1gbs-10^9 biits/s

how are countries connected through networks:
Its not through clous but there is large bunch of wires buried under oceans
physiccaly: optical fibers cables
wireless: bluetooth,wifi, 34 bits

LAN: (local area network)
-->group of offices/housees
in an area it is

Ethernet cables

MAN(Metroprlenton area network): across cities they are connected each other

WAN: wide area network -->across thecountry
using optical fiber cable
SONET
frame delay

Internet is a collection of LAN,MAN,WAN

Modem-->used too convert digital signal into electrical signal

Various ways computer are connected
TOPOLOGIES
BUS topologies--> like a bus all the computers are connected
RING topologu--> like a ring
STAR topology--> a central device is connected in between all
TREE topology-->(mixture of bus and start topology)
many stars are connected in a bus kin of a way
MESH topology-->evey computer is connected to every single computer
         expensive, scalability issues

Structure of network:
=
OSI model(Open systems Inter connection Model)
7 LAYERS
 
Application layer
presentaion layer
session layer
Transport layer
Network layer
Data link Layer
Physical Layer 

Application Layer--> Its implemented in software-->consist of applications
Presentaion Layer-->Take the data from application layer, this can be in any form character/ letters etc, it is converted into bytes/bits, the data is encryped, also provides abstraction, data is compressed(loss will depends)
Session layer-->helps in setting upa nd managing data, Authentication, authorization. SEssion is basically likr, when we logged into any particular e-commerce site -like Amazon, we purchase things, then buy it pay, then log out of that particular site
that particular time or process between log in  log out can be termed as sessions
Transport layer-->any data comes from session layer is divide into several small small segments, every segments consist of source and sequence and port number, It has flow control system(), error control system
connection oriented transportation called TCP and connectioless transportation is called UDP
TCP example email
UDP example video conferences

TILL HERE IT WAS INSIDE OUR OWN COMPUTERS
NOW ITS OTHER COMPUTERS

Network  layer-->connecting with other computers
Logical addressing,  IP packets is assigned , as every computer having diff IP addressses, it perform Routing
data link layer--> Here it will recive data in the form of packets from sender, packets will consist of sender and receivers IP address.
Physical addressing is done here--> MAC address-->Is a 12 digit alpha numeric number --> our computer will not have only one MAC address, our bluetook might have some MAC address, wifi might have some MAC  address
adds MAC address to packets
Phisiscal --> hardware , having cables, wires.

ANOTHER MODEL

TCP/IP model

layers are reduced here:

Application layer
Transport layer
Network layer
Data link layer 
Physical layer

-------APPLICATION LAYER-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-users interact here
- whatsapp,etc
-where--devices
-they have some protocols
-Client server Architecture

I want to watch some youtube video
CLIENT- im the client here
SERVER- youtube is server here
process- how rewuest send and responses recived

Host our own server--unique IP addresses

Client-server architecture
peer-to-peer architecture

Repeater-->present in network layer, it regenerate the signal over the same networl before signal becomes wwea or corruped
they dont amplify signal , but they just copy th signal bit by bit and regerate in its original stringth
its a 2 port device
Hub--> its  a multiport device,it connects multiple wires  coming from different branches.



------------------TRANSPORTATION LAYER--------------------------------------------------------------------

Let say we are using some messanger website, we write some message and send it to some messenger application , it is sent to person we wanted to
one msg sent from one computer to another is work of transportation
transport layer - layer which does this transportation process is termed as transport layer.

within the same device data transfirm happening through transport layer.
b/w two corrier companies from diff countries is network layer

transport layer - working on its own device., then transfer data to network layer

transport layer is present in our own laptop

protocols in Transport layer -  TCP(transport control protocol) - if we want to transport data exactly same to same, with acknowledgement, oredered data packets

ex: a friend sending diff application to your system - that is through network layer
once applications reached our system, then those applications need to be transmitted to its own loc - transport Layer

types of data receiving

multiplexing and demultiplexing

sending all this through multiplexer, then passed through demultiplexing
internally how?, we refer machines through IP addresses, we refer applications through port numbers, sockets are like gateways to connect two applications and networks
data travel in packets, using IP addresses they decide to which data it need to be connected to

transport layer takes care of congestion control - its like when so many peoeple try to get int to same space

congestion control happens in transport and network layer using some congestion control algo built in TCP

message -
file -
vc -

what if data get corrupted or lost?

using checksums - its a random number
using algorithms , sender will calculate the checksum value, and reveiver cal the checksum using same algo, if value is same , then no error

how to know if packet reveieved ?
timers

how to avoid duplicate values when packet gets lost or not sent?
sequence number , its a unique id for identification

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

protocol

TRANSPORT LAYER - TCP/UDP
NETWORK LAYER - IP
APPLICATION LAYER - HTTP

UDP - (USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL)
data may or may not be delivered, data may be changed on the way
data may not be in oredered

//email do not use UDP ,if it does data would have corrupted or lost
its a connectionless protocol

UDP - uses checksums
